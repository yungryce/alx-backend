# ALX Backend Engineering

Welcome to the **alx-backend** container project, part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. This repository brings together core backend engineering concepts and hands-on projects, each focusing on a critical area of backend development.

## Project Overview

The `alx-backend` repository is organized into several nested projects, each targeting a specific backend topic:

- **Pagination**: Efficiently serving large datasets in manageable chunks.
- **Caching**: Improving performance and scalability by storing computed results.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Supporting multiple languages and locales.
- **Queueing Systems**: Managing asynchronous tasks and background processing.

Each subproject is self-contained, with its own implementation, documentation, and tests.

## Technology Stack

| Category      | Technologies                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Languages** | Python 3.x, JavaScript (Node.js)    |
| **Frameworks**| Flask, Babel                        |
| **Data**      | Redis, CSV, JSON                    |
| **Testing**   | unittest, custom scripts            |
| **Other**     | Shell scripting, Linux tools        |

## Repository Structure

| Directory                  | Description                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `0x00-pagination/`         | Pagination algorithms and helpers           |
| `0x01-caching/`            | Caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, LFU, MRU)    |
| `0x02-i18n/`               | Internationalization with Flask/Babel       |
| `0x03-queuing_system_in_js/` | Queueing and job processing with Node.js/Redis |
| `README.md`                | This file                                   |
| `requirements.txt`         | Python dependencies for container project   |

Each nested project contains its own `README.md` and documentation.
