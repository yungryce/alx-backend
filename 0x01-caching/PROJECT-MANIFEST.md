# Project Manifest: Caching

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Caching
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Cache replacement policies, backend optimization
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Python 3.x
- **Environment**: Cross-platform
- **Libraries/Tools**: Standard Library
- **Style Guide**: PEP8

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Implementation of cache replacement algorithms (FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, LFU)
- Object-oriented design for extensible cache classes
- Evaluation of algorithmic trade-offs
- Testing and validation of cache behavior
- Documentation of caching strategies

## System Context
This module demonstrates core caching strategies essential for scalable backend systems. Mastery of these algorithms is foundational for performance optimization in real-world applications.

## Development Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)

## Development Workflow
1. Implement abstract base cache class
2. Develop concrete cache classes for each policy
3. Write and run test scripts for each implementation
4. Document usage and behavior

## Maintenance Notes
- Extendable for additional cache policies
- Designed for educational clarity and modularity
