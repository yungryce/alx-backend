# Project Manifest: Queuing System in JS

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Queuing System in JS
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Queuing systems, job queues, Node.js, Redis, publish/subscribe, asynchronous processing
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Node.js
- **Environment**: Cross-platform
- **Libraries/Tools**: Redis, Mocha
- **Style Guide**: Standard JS

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Implementing job queues and workers
- Using Redis for backend operations
- Real-time messaging with publish/subscribe
- Asynchronous job processing and error handling

## System Context
This module demonstrates how to build backend systems that use queues for job management and real-time notifications, foundational for scalable and distributed applications.

## Development Requirements
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- Redis server
- Text Editor (VSCode, vim, etc.)
- `package.json` dependencies

## Development Workflow
1. Set up Redis server and Node.js environment
2. Implement Redis client and operations modules
3. Build job queue and worker scripts
4. Add publish/subscribe functionality
5. Write and run automated tests
6. Document usage and edge cases

## Maintenance Notes
- Easily extendable for more complex queue logic
- Designed for educational clarity and modularity
