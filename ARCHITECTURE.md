# Architecture Overview - ALX Backend Engineering

This document describes the architectural design, system components, and data flow of the `alx-backend` container project and its nested modules.

## Architectural Pattern

The `alx-backend` project follows a **modular layered architecture**. Each subproject is self-contained and focuses on a specific backend engineering concept, enabling clear separation of concerns, reusability, and scalability. Where applicable, subprojects may internally follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern (e.g., Flask-based APIs).

## High-Level Structure

```
alx-backend/
├── 0x00-pagination/           # Pagination algorithms and helpers
├── 0x01-caching/              # Caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, LFU, MRU)
├── 0x02-i18n/                 # Internationalization with Flask/Babel
├── 0x03-queuing_system_in_js/ # Queueing and job processing with Node.js/Redis
├── README.md                  # Container-level documentation
├── SKILLS-INDEX.md            # Skills index for the container project
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies (if any)
└── .repo-context.json         # Metadata for AI-assistant and project context
```

Each nested project is self-contained, with its own implementation files, documentation, and tests.

## Main System Components

- **API Layer / Controller:** Handles incoming requests, validates input, and routes to the appropriate logic. (Flask APIs, Node.js endpoints)
- **Processing Layer:** Applies business logic such as pagination, caching, internationalization, or queueing.
- **Data Layer:** Interacts with data sources (CSV, JSON, Redis, etc.) and returns results.
- **Response Layer:** Formats and returns the response to the client or next system.

### Subproject Roles

- **0x00-pagination:** Implements efficient pagination algorithms and helper functions for slicing, page navigation, and metadata generation.
- **0x01-caching:** Demonstrates multiple caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, LFU, MRU) for performance optimization and resource management.
- **0x02-i18n:** Adds internationalization (i18n) support using Flask and Babel, handling locale selection, translation files, and dynamic content adaptation.
- **0x03-queuing_system_in_js:** Implements asynchronous job queueing and processing using Node.js and Redis, demonstrating event-driven programming and background task management.

## Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each subproject addresses a single backend topic.
- **Reusability:** Helper modules and patterns are designed for reuse across projects.
- **Scalability:** The structure supports easy addition of new backend modules.
- **Documentation:** Each module includes its own README and usage instructions.

## Technology Integration
- **Python/Flask:** Used for API endpoints, i18n, and backend logic.
- **Node.js/Redis:** Used for queueing and asynchronous job processing.
- **Babel:** Manages translations and locale files.
- **Testing:** Each module includes tests (unittest, custom scripts) for validation.

## Extensibility
- New backend topics can be added as new subdirectories, following the established pattern.
- Shared utilities and patterns can be promoted to the container level if needed.
